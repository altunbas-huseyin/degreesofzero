	<p>To think that humanity is here by some divine intervention; that the Universe was so devoid of purpose that it decided to create us to occupy it. Think of the hubris it takes to believe this mass-delusion. That&#39;s religion. And, that&#39;s nationalism. Sprung forth from the same watering hole; a bottomless well of ignorance and self congratulation. Good job. You&#39;re here. Like the rest of us.</p>

	<p>Why do you need a purpose? Is trying to be as &quot;good&quot; a human being as you can be not enough of one?</p>

	<p>Some might call this great cosmic accident a &quot;gift.&quot; What have you done lately to live up to this opportunity given to you by the Universe? Is there really nothing that can inspire you? Why wake up in the morning? Why bother? The Universe is unimagineably big. And, it&#39;s filled with things we don&#39;t even know exist yet. How can you not want to be a part, how ever small, in this grand cosmic experiment -- the human race. So much to experience; out there, down here. Do what you love. Do what makes you happy. Don&#39;t chase money. Chase a dream.</p>

	<p>Maybe that is the purpose: to explore, to learn, to let our dreams take us further than we have ever been before. Shrug off your flag, your colors, your dogma. We are all in this together. On this big blue marble, hurtling through space. Let&#39;s try and make the best of it.</p>
