	<p>In this tutorial I will walk you through the process of creating and restoring a database backup from Terminal in Ubuntu.</p>

<br><h3>Create a Database Backup</h3><p>We&#39;re going to use <i>mysqldump</i> to create a backup of the database, and we&#39;re going to compress the backup with gzip.</p><pre class="code" data-type="code">mysqldump -u user_name -h localhost -p database_name | gzip -9 &gt; backup_name.sql.gz</pre><p>Replace <i>user_name</i> with your MySQL user name.</p><p>Replace <i>database_name</i> with the name of the database you wish to export.</p><br><h3>Restore the Database Backup</h3><p>From the terminal of the server to which you wish to import the database backup, use the following command:</p><pre class="code" data-type="code">zcat /path/to/database/backup/backup_name.sql.gz | mysql -u user_name -p database_name</pre><p>Replace <i>user_name</i> with your MySQL user name. You&#39;ll be prompted for this user&#39;s password.</p><p>Replace <i>database_name</i> with the name of the database you wish to import.</p><br><p>That&#39;s it!</p><p>Now, if you are feeling extra fancy, I&#39;ve included additional instructions for deploying a database backup from one remote server to another:</p><br><h3>Deploying a Database to Another Server</h3><p>Exporting and importing your database backups via terminal is also useful if you need to deploy a copy of a database from one server to another. Since you&#39;ve already done the export on one server, let&#39;s focus on the server to which you want to import the database.</p><br><h4>Transferring the Database Backup</h4><p>Do <strong>NOT</strong> use File Transfer Protocal (FTP). FTP is fun and all, but here we&#39;re going to use a more efficient mechanism. <a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man1/scp.1.html">Secure Copy</a> has a number of benefits over the lesser methods of transferring files:</p><ul><li><strong>One Less Trip</strong> - No need to download from one server just to upload to another.</li><li><strong>Faster Transfers</strong> - Servers tend to have good internet connections. Once <i>your</i> computer is out of the equation, the transfer rate is going to be orders of magnitude better.</li><li><strong>It&#39;s Secure</strong> - Not only does it have <i>secure</i> in the name, but it also uses SSH for authentication and data transfer.</li></ul><br><p>So let&#39;s get down to it then. From the server to which you wish to import the database, use the following command:</p><pre class="code" data-type="code">sudo scp user_name@ip_address:/file/path/to/backup/backup_name.sql.gz ./</pre><p>Replace <i>user_name</i> with the username you usually use to SSH into the remote server. You&#39;ll be prompted for this user&#39;s password.</p><p>Replace <i>ip_address</i> with the IP Address of the remote server that has the database export on it.</p><p>Replace <i>/file/path/to/backup/backup_name.sql.gz</i> with the full file path of the database export on the remote server.</p><br><p>Now that you&#39;ve got the database backup on the second server, all you have to do is <i>Restore the Database Backup</i> using the instructions from earlier in this tutorial.</p>
