<p>We are all human beings. We are in this together. We should never forget that.</p><p>This is a short list of things we <i>value</i> to help us remember:</p><p><i style="color:#117A18">Accepting responsibility</i> <i>over</i> <i style="color:#821010">Passing blame onto others</i></p><p><i style="color:#117A18">Voicing your opinion</i> <i>over</i> <i style="color:#821010">Staying silent</i></p><p><i style="color:#117A18">Sharing knowledge freely</i> <i>over</i> <i style="color:#821010">Hording it for yourself</i></p><p><i style="color:#117A18">Offering an empathetic ear</i> <i>over</i> <i style="color:#821010">Pretending to listen</i></p><p><i style="color:#117A18">Helping your fellow humans</i> <i>over</i> <i style="color:#821010">Looking out only for yourself</i></p><p><i style="color:#117A18">Sticking up for a friend</i> <i>over</i> <i style="color:#821010">Fear</i></p><p><i style="color:#117A18">Forgiving when forgiveness is earned</i> <i>over</i> <i style="color:#821010">Holding grudges</i></p><p><i style="color:#117A18">Trying to better yourself</i> <i>over</i> <i style="color:#821010">Thinking you don&#39;t need to</i></p><p>That is to say, the things on the left should be valued over the things on the right.</p><p>This list is in no ways perfect. It is simply a list of things that I have personally experienced in recent months, and felt the need to spew into written form. If this list inspires you in any small way, great.</p><p>Please remember, that everyone is deserving of at least a chance to enjoy life. No one is perfect. We are all just trying to figure things out.</p>
