<p>If you&#39;re a big fan of using secure HTTP as much as possible, you might have already thought about how to use the encrypted version of Google search as the default search in your address bar. Here&#39;s how you do it:</p><p>Go to this address in Chrome:</p><p><a href="chrome://settings/searchEngines">chrome://settings/searchEngines</a></p><p>At the bottom of this page is where you&#39;ll &quot;Add a new search engine.&quot;</p><p>In the first box, put the name of the new Search Engine:</p><pre class="code" data-type="code">Google (secure)</pre><p>In the second box, put the keyword for the new Search Engine:</p><pre class="code" data-type="code">google.com (secure)</pre><p>Enter the following URL in the third box:</p><pre class="code" data-type="code">https://encrypted.google.com/search?{google:RLZ}{google:acceptedSuggestion}{google:originalQueryForSuggestion}sourceid=chrome&amp;ie={inputEncoding}&amp;q=%s</pre><p>And finally, you&#39;ll need to make the search engine you just added your default. Simply mouse over the new search engine in the list, and click &quot;Make Default.&quot;</p><p>Now to test it, open up a new tab and enter a test search query. If all is well, you should see the results of your search on <a href="https://encrypted.google.com">encrypted Google</a>.</p>
