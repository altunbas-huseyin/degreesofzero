<p>If you have already <a href="/article/49">installed GIMP 2.8</a>, then you&#39;re off to a good start. Now we&#39;re going to change a couple things from the default configuration to make GIMP a little bit more useful and intuitive; or at the very least, more like the image editing programs we&#39;ve become accustomed to.</p><h3>Layer Effects</h3><p>This is a big one. First, you&#39;ll need to <a href="http://registry.gimp.org/files/layerfx.2.8.py.txt">download layerfx for GIMP 2.8</a>. Yes, for some reason it opens as a text file in your browser instead of downloading as a file. That&#39;s ok. Left click once on the text (anywhere). Select all (<i>CTRL + A</i>) and copy (<i>CTRL + C</i>).</p><p><i>Note: The reason I suggest using the python version (.py) is because it allows <strong>Previewing</strong>.</i></p><p>Now, open up terminal. Create a new python plugin in your GIMP plugins directory:</p><pre class="code">cd ~/.gimp-2.8/plug-ins<br>sudo gedit layerfx.py</pre><p>Paste the contents of the layerfx python plugin (<i>CTRL + V</i>). Save and close the file.</p><p>Now back in the terminal window, set the permissions on the layerfx plugin file to be executable:</p><pre class="code">chmod +x layerfx.py</pre><p>Finally, open GIMP. If you had it open already, close it then reopen it.</p><p>If you installed the plugin correctly, you should be able to reach the layer effects menu at <i>Layer -> Layer Effects</i>.</p><p>For more info about the Layer Effects plug-in, see:</p><p><a href="http://registry.gimp.org/node/186">http://registry.gimp.org/node/186</a></p><br><h3>Select Layer with Left-Click</h3><p>If you have ever had to chop up a layered image composition for a website or GUI, you know why this is useful. Being able to left click on a layer to select it can save you tons of time that would otherwise have been wasted searching through hundreds of layers manually.</p><p>In GIMP, go to <i>Edit -> Preferences</i>. Now go to <i>Tool Options</i>. At the bottom of this screen, you&#39;ll see a check box with the following text next to it:</p><pre class="code">Set layer or path as active</pre><p>Check this box and hit "OK."</p><p>Now when you are using the <i>Move Tool</i> and left click somewhere in an image, the layer you just clicked will become the selected / active layer.</p>
