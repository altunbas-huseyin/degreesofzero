<p>There are a number of use cases where by logging in via SSH (without a password) is the best (or maybe only) option. For example, if you wanted to run an automated backup on a remote server that would upload files to another remote server via <i>scp</i>, you would need SSH to work without a password. This post will guide you through the process of setting up passwordless SSH, such that you will be able to use <i>scp</i> and other utilities that rely upon SSH for authentication without having to use a password.</p><br><h3>Step 1: Generate a Private/Public Key Pair</h3><p>Open up a terminal window on the machine from which you wish to access a remote machine.</p><p>Check to see if you already have an RSA key for the current user:</p><pre class="code">cd ~/.ssh<br>ls -l</pre><p>If the following files already exist, then you can skip this step:</p><pre class="code">-rw------- 1 user group 1502 Jul  18  2013 id_rsa<br>-rw-r--r-- 1 user group  360 Jul  18  2013 id_rsa.pub</pre><p>If you don&#39;t already have the files, run the following command:</p><pre class="code">ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -t rsa</pre><p>When prompted to enter a pass phrase, just hit enter (both times). This will allow the use of the RSA key without a password.</p><br><h3>Step 2: Copy the Public Key to the Remote Server</h3><p>Use <i>scp</i> to transfer your public key file to the remote server that you wish to access:</p><pre class="code">scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user_name@ip_address:~/</pre><p>Replace <i>user_name</i> with the username you usually use to SSH into the remote server. You&#39;ll be prompted for this user&#39;s password.</p><p>Replace <i>ip_address</i> with the IP Address of the remote server that has the database export on it.</p><br><h3>Step 3: Add Public Key to Remote Server&#39;s Authorized Keys File</h3><p>Secure shell (SSH) into the remote server:</p><pre class="code">ssh user_name@ip_address</pre><p>Replace <i>user_name</i> with the username you usually use to SSH into the remote server. You&#39;ll be prompted for this user&#39;s password.</p><p>Replace <i>ip_address</i> with the IP Address of the remote server that has the database export on it.</p><p>Append the Public Key to the remote server&#39;s authorized keys file:</p><pre class="code">cat ~/id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</pre><p>Set the appropriate permissions on the authorized keys file:</p><pre class="code">chmod 0644 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</pre><p>Delete the Public Key file, just to tidy up:</p><pre class="code">rm ~/id_rsa.pub</pre><br><h3>Step 4: Test</h3><p>Open a new terminal window, and try to secure shell into the remote server again:</p><pre class="code">ssh user_name@ip_address</pre><p>You should no longer be prompted for a password and the secure shell session should start right away.</p>
