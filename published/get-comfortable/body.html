<p>No clue. No clear direction. No end in sight. Yet, you press on. This is what it is to be a developer at times. What separates the mediocre from the great, is the will to continue. Things aren&#39;t always going to be easy, or fun. You&#39;re going to yell at your computer screen. You&#39;re going to wish you were doing something else, anything else. But, there is light at the end of the tunnel. There will come a time when you realize the solution. And it will be worth all that frustration and anguish you&#39;ve endured to get there. And you will remember why you love doing what you do.</p>
