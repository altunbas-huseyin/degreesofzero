<p>I recently decided to try out the Developer branch of CodeIgniter. I quickly discovered that the documentation that comes with CodeIgniter&#39;s source files needs to be &quot;built&quot; before it can be viewed as HTML. To do this requires the <a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man1/sphinx-build.1.html">Sphinx documentation generator tool</a>.</p><h3>Install Sphinx Documentation Generator Tool</h3><p>First, check to see if you have Python installed:</p><pre class="code" data-type="code">python --version</pre><p>If you do not already have Python installed, you&#39;ll need to install it:</p><pre class="code" data-type="code">sudo apt-get install python2.7</pre><p>Now, you&#39;ll need to install python set up tools, because we&#39;ll be using <i>easy_install</i>:</p><pre class="code" data-type="code">sudo apt-get install python-setuptools</pre><p>Now, install sphinx and an extension for PHP language support:</p><pre class="code" data-type="code">sudo easy_install sphinx<br>sudo easy_install sphinxcontrib-phpdomain</pre><p>Now, install the CodeIgniter Lexer to Pygments:</p><pre class="code" data-type="code">cd user_guide_src/cilexer<br>sudo python setup.py install</pre><p>For additional info about this, or if you encounter any issues, see the <i>README</i> file contained within the <i>user_guide_src/cilexer</i> directory.</p><p>To confirm that the CodeIgniter Lexer was installed correctly to Pygments, try the following:</p><pre class="code" data-type="code">pygmentize -L</pre><p>The following should appear somewhere in the output from the above command:</p><pre class="code" data-type="code">* ci, codeigniter:<br>    CodeIgniter (filenames *.html, *.css, *.php, *.xml, *.static)</pre><br><p>In my terminal window the output was being clipped. If this happens to you, try outputting the results of the command to a file:</p><pre class="code" data-type="code">pygmentize -L &gt; output.txt</pre><p>You can then open the file in your preferred text editing program to easily view the full output.</p><br><h3>Build the User Guide</h3><p>Finally you are ready to build the User Guide from source:</p><pre class="code" data-type="code">make html</pre><p>That&#39;s it! You should now be able to view the User Guide as HTML in your browser. The built HTML files should be located at <i>user_guide_src/build/html</i>. A good starting point would be the root index.html file:</p><pre class="code" data-type="code">build/html/index.html</pre>
