<p>Go crazy? Well, maybe not..</p>

	<p>I had another fun encounter with Internet Explorer this week. Apparently <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2011/05/14/internet-explorer-stylesheet-rule-selector-import-sheet-limit-maximum.aspx">IE (6-9) enforces a hard limit for the number of CSS rules that it will accept in a single style sheet.</a> Yup, you read that correctly. Just when I started to forget how much I disliked IE, it goes and proves to me once again just how worthy of my disdain it truly is.</p>

<p> I also feel the need to mention that the <i>only</i> browser that had this problem was IE. But, anyways.. I&#39;m not bitter.</p>

<h3>How on Earth Do You End Up With 4095+ CSS Rules?</h3>
<p>Now, I feel I should start with a little back story to get you up to speed with how I got here. So, I&#39;ve been using an application called <a href="https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX">pdf2htmlEX</a> to convert gigantic PDF files (500MB+, 700+ pages) to HTML. To get the HTML to look almost exactly like the original PDF, the application uses a lot of absolute positioning of text; sometimes even individual letters are positioned absolutely by themselves. Needless to say, this leads to quite a lot of CSS rules. All in all, after converting one of these giant PDF files, I ended up with a style sheet with almost 12,000 CSS rules.</p>

<p>Before I went crazy with writing some code to chop up my giant CSS files into something IE will digest, I decided to test to make sure this was actually the problem. Using my IDE, I manually chopped up the CSS file into chunks of no more than 4095 rules each. Sure enough once I did this, IE decided it would render everything just fine. Amazing.</p>

<h3>Great, Now What to Do About It?</h3>
<p>Now that I knew for sure what the problem was, and how to fix it, I just had to code it. Here&#39;s a mini-library for CodeIgniter that I used to remedy this situation:</p>
<pre class="code php">&lt;?php  if ( ! defined(&#039;BASEPATH&#039;)) exit(&#039;No direct script access allowed&#039;);

class Css
{

	/*
		Chop up the given CSS into chunks with no more than the given # of rules each.
	*/
	public function chop($css, $max_num_rules)
	{
		$chunks = array();

		$offset = 0;

		/*
			Find all the rules in the given CSS.
		*/
		while (
			preg_match_all(&#039;~\{[^\{\}]+\}~&#039;, $css, $matches, PREG_OFFSET_CAPTURE, $offset) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp;
			isset($matches[0][$max_num_rules])
		)
		{
			$pos1 = $matches[0][$max_num_rules - 1][1] + strlen($matches[0][$max_num_rules - 1][0]);
			$pos2 = $matches[0][$max_num_rules][1];

			$chunks[] = substr($css, $offset, $pos1 - $offset);

			$offset = $pos1;
		}

		// The left-overs.
		$chunks[] = substr($css, $offset);

		if (count($chunks) &gt; 1)
			// We may have broken media queries in the CSS, let&#039;s fix them.
			$chunks = $this-&gt;fix_broken_media_queries($chunks);

		return $chunks;
	}

	/*
		Looks for and closes any open media queries in the given CSS.
	*/
	protected function fix_broken_media_queries($chunks)
	{
		$open_media_queries = array();

		foreach ($chunks as $i =&gt; $css)
		{
			if (count($open_media_queries) &gt; 0)
				foreach ($open_media_queries as $media_query)
					$css = $media_query . $css;

			$n = 0;
			$offset = 0;

			while (preg_match(&#039;~@media [^\{]+\{~&#039;, $css, $matches, PREG_OFFSET_CAPTURE, $offset) === 1)
			{
				// Add to the array of open media queries.
				$open_media_queries[$n] = $matches[0][0];

				/*
					Set &#039;pos1&#039; to just after the media query declaration.
				*/
				$pos1 = $matches[0][1] + strlen($matches[0][0]);

				$offset = $pos1;

				// Get the closing bracket of the media query.
				if (($pos2 = $this-&gt;find_next_closing_bracket($css, $offset)) !== false)
				{
					// Found it!

					$offset = ($pos2 + 1);

					// Remove this media query from the array of open media queries.
					if (isset($open_media_queries[$n]))
						unset($open_media_queries[$n]);
				}
				else
				{
					// Couldn&#039;t find the closing bracket for this media query.

					// Close the open media query for this chunk.
					$css .= &#039;}&#039;;
				}
				
				$n++;
			}

			$chunks[$i] = $css;
		}

		return $chunks;
	}

	/*
		Finds the next closing bracket in the given CSS, starting at the given offset.
	*/
	protected function find_next_closing_bracket($css, &amp;$offset)
	{
		while (
			($pos2 = strpos($css, &#039;}&#039;, $offset)) !== false &amp;&amp;
			($pos3 = strpos($css, &#039;{&#039;, $offset)) !== false &amp;&amp;
			$pos3 &lt; $pos2
		)
			$offset = ($pos2 + 1);

		return $pos2;
	}

}

<p>And an example of the fix in action:</p>
<pre class="code php">&lt;?php if ( ! defined(&#039;BASEPATH&#039;)) exit(&#039;No direct script access allowed&#039;);

class Test extends CI_Controller
{

    function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct();
    }

    public function index()
    {
        $this-&gt;load-&gt;library(&#039;Css&#039;);

        $chunks = $this-&gt;css-&gt;chop($css, 4095);

        foreach ($chunks as $i =&gt; $chunk)
        {
            $file = &#039;/file/path/to/css/directory/chunk-&#039; . ($i + 1) . &#039;.css&#039;;

            file_put_contents($file, $chunk);
        }
    }
    
}</pre>
