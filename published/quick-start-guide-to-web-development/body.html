	<p>This is a short, to the point guide for anyone trying to get started with web development. This is not meant to be an exhaustive resource or to cover any particular topics in depth. Instead this is meant as a quick explanation of a few things to help total newbies get started.</p>

	<br>

	<h3>The Basics</h3>
	<p>All websites and Internet-based applications were built by Web Programmers. Web Programming is not difficult to get into. There are 3 fundamental technologies (programming languages) that are used to create pretty much all websites: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. These "languages" are just text telling web browsers what to make the web site look like and how it should function:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>HTML</strong> is used to create the structure of a website
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>CSS</strong> is used to "style" a website (colors, shapes, lines, etc.)
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>JavaScript</strong> is used to bring additional functionality to a website
		</li>
	</ul>

	<br>

	<h3>How to Get Started</h3>
	<p>Now before you begin, you&#39;ll want to make sure you&#39;re using the right tools. Let&#39;s start with your web browser. If you&#39;re using a computer with Windows on it, you&#39;re most likely using Internet Explorer to browse the web. There are a number of reasons why Internet Explorer is bad for web programming, but I won&#39;t go into all that right now. That being said, I recommend using <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Google Chrome</a>. It&#39;s completely free to download and use.</p>

	<br>

	<h4>Use a Text Editor for Programming</h4>
	<p>You don&#39;t need this right away, but I recommend getting <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">SublimeText</a> eventually. You will probably need to download the regular Windows version. It is free to download and use for an unlimited trial period.</p>

	<br>

	<h4>Learning Web Programming</h4>
	<p>There are a lot of great, free resources for learning web programming:</p>
	<p><a href="http://learncss.tutsplus.com/">Great series of videos to help you get started with CSS</a></p>
	<p><a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/html_cheatsheet/">A simple reference for HTML</a></p>
	<p>A good way to learn is to look at the source code of other people&#39;s websites, to see how they work; I wrote a <a href="/article/34">tutorial</a> that will walk you through how to do just that.</p>
	<p>If you are ever stuck on something, try to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">search for a solution</a>. More than likely someone else has already run into the problem and has found a solution that has been posted somewhere.</p>
	<p>One of the most useful sites I use whenever I run into specific programming-related problem is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">StackOverFlow</a>.</p>

	<br>

	<p>By far the most important thing to remember is that it isn&#39;t easy; and that&#39;s ok! If you can stick with it long enough, you will learn that those tough times are a necessary part of the whole. And, when you figure something out for the first time for yourself, it will all be worth it.</p>
