<p>The <span class="code">bitcoind</span> package that is available in the universal Ubuntu repositories is a very old version. You could add the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~bitcoin/+archive/bitcoin">bitcoin PPA</a> and then install bitcoind from that; this will get you a stable version of bitcoind that is at most a month or two old. But, if you're the extra careful type, it doesn't hurt your peace-of-mind to have built bitcoind from source yourself.</p>

<p>This tutorial assumes you've already <a href="https://degreesofzero.com/article/building-bitcoind-from-source-on-ubuntu.html">built bitcoind from source</a>. If you haven't done that, go ahead and do that now.</p>

<h3>Dependencies</h3>

<p>To get <span class="code">add-apt-repository</span>, which we will use later to add the bitcoin PPA:</p>
<pre class="code">
sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
</pre>

<p>Add the bitcoin PPA to get access to the <span class="code">libdb4.8++-dev</span> package:</p>
<pre class="code">
add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
apt-get update
</pre>

<p>Now you can install all the dependencies:</p>
<pre class="code">
apt-get install libboost-all-dev libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev
</pre>
<p>If you're reading this from the future, you may want to check with the readme file(s) to verify that you have all the required dependencies; they may have changed since this article was written.</p>


<h3>The Binary</h3>

<p>Put the bitcoind binary that you built from the previous tutorial in the <span class="code">/usr/local/bin</span> directory. Then add a symlink in <span class="code">/usr/bin</span>:</p>
<pre class="code">
ln -s /usr/local/bin/bitcoind /usr/bin/bitcoind
</pre>


<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>Before starting bitcoind, you'll want to create the <span class="code">bitcoin.conf</span> configuration file:</p>
<pre class="code">
cd ~/
mkdir .bitcoin
cd .bitcoin
vim bitcoin.conf
</pre>

<p>Add the following to <span class="code">bitcoin.conf</span>:</p>
<pre class="code">
server=1
daemon=1
testnet=1
rpcuser=UNIQUE_RPC_USERNAME
rpcpassword=UNIQUE_RPC_PASSWORD
</pre>
<p>If you wish to use this installation on the regular bitcoin network, remove <span class="code">testnet=1</span>.</p>


<h3>Starting bitcoind</h3>

<p>Now you're ready to start bitcoind. Simply enter the following in your terminal:</p>
<pre class="code">
bitcoind
</pre>
<p>If all is well, <span class="code">Bitcoin server starting</span> should be printed to the terminal.</p>

<p>To view info about your bitcoind instance enter the following:</p>
<pre class="code">
bitcoind getinfo
</pre>
<p>If you receive <span class="code">error: couldn't connect to server</span> after starting bitcoind, you may need to simply wait a little bit for bitcoind to finish its pre-start checks.</p>

<p>To view a list of all available commands:</p>
<pre class="code">
bitcoind help
</pre>

<p>It's important to note that you may wish to take additional steps to secure your bitcoin installation. These steps may vary depending upon the purpose of the installation. I will cover this topic in future articles.</p>

<p>Happy bitcoining!</p>
