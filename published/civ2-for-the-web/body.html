<p>This was my attempt at reverse engineering the epic turn-based strategy game, Civilization 2. It was my first attempt at creating a game, and the first time I&#39;ve used BackBoneJS. Local Storage is used to store settings and saved games. You can see the source <a href="https://github.com/chill117/civ2web">here</a>.</p><p>I don&#39;t have any plans to continue development in the near-term. One of these days I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll pick it up again.</p><div class="center"><div class="image"><a href="/images/civ2web/screenshot001.jpg" title="The home screen"><img src="/images/civ2web/screenshot001.jpg" alt="The home screen" /></a><p class="caption">The home screen</p></div></div><p>If I were to pick it up again, I&#39;d probably start by foregoing the idea of doing a 1 to 1 port of the game in its entirety. Instead, I think I&#39;d focus on updating its usability a bit and doing my best to maintain the core of what made the game great. One quick usability fix would be to combine the nearly dozen individual pre-game setting screens into no more than three. Perhaps even a "Quick Start" with some kind of general (or randomized) settings.</p><br><div class="center"><div class="image"><a href="/images/civ2web/screenshot002.jpg" title="In game view"><img src="/images/civ2web/screenshot002.jpg" alt="In game view" /></a><p class="caption">In game view</p></div></div><p>By far my favorite part of working on this project so far has been the map generator. I basically had to backwards engineer the tiling algorithms of Civ2 to perfectly replicate how it draws its tiles and its shorelines. I was really quite pleased with how that part turned out. </p><br><div class="center"><div class="image"><a href="/images/civ2web/screenshot003.jpg" title="Loading a saved game"><img src="/images/civ2web/screenshot003.jpg" alt="Loading a saved game" /></a><p class="caption">Loading a saved game</p></div></div><p>As I stated previously, game data is saved to the client&#39;s local storage. The only data stored right now are the game settings and the map data.</p><p>If you are interested in picking this up, please feel free! All I ask is that you let me know about your progress and let me alpha test it whenever you feel it&#39;s close to playable :)</p>
